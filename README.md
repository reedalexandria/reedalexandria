### What am I up to? 

🌱 I'm currently enrolled in a [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science/academics-meds) (MEDS) degree program at UC Santa Barbara. I have over five years of experience in the environmental industry, most recently working as an Environmental Specialist for the Engineering and Environmental Sciences Department at Citadel EHS. I help evaluate and identify environmental impacts and recommend solutions.

⚽ In my spare time, I enjoy playing sports like soccer and beach volleyball. I also enjoy hiking and running. Fun fact: I went to cross-country nationals in high school (my team came in 3rd place)! One day I plan on scraping my Strava data using the `{rStrava]` package and plotting an interactive map using `leaflet`. 

### Experience

- 2018 - present: Environmental Specialist (Citadel EHS)

### Education

- MEDS (expected 2023): Environmental Data Science (UC Santa Barbara)
- BS (2017): Environmental Studies (UC Santa Barbara)
